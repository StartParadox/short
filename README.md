# Short
Nothing new, a simple url shortener chrome extension. Gives shortened url as soon as icon is clicked, copies the shortened url to clipboard when user clicks "Copy" button. Looks clean (I think..).

#Demo
You can try the extension by enabling developer mode from the chrome://extensions settings and loading the unpacked extension.
